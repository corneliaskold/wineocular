                    <h2>Chardonnay</h2>
                    <p>The grape itself is relatively neutral, with fresh appley
                        aromas, but techniques such as oak ageing (which adds vanilla,
                        toast or toffee aromas), malolactic fermentation and lees
                        stirring all add different layers of flavour and complexity.</p>

                    <h2>Sauvignon Blanc</h2>
                    <p>In general, sauvignon blanc is used to make dry wines,
                        distinctive for their fresh acidity and beautiful perfume.
                        In cooler climates the wines often have bright citrus and
                        mineral notes combined with a green nettle character.
                        Oak ageing, lees stirring and malolactic fermentation
                        can also produce sauvignons that are rounded rich and full.</p>

                    <h2>Pinot Grigio</h2>
                    <p>This grape is charmingly light and fresh with
                        citrus, peach and floral aromas. It's brilliant drunk on
                        its own as an aperitif or with salads and creamy cheeses.
                        Everyday pinot grigios are a great place to start for simple,
                        fresh, fruity white wines for easy drinking.</p>

                    <h2>Gewürztraminer</h2>
                    <p>Expect scents of sweet spice, plump pink roses,
                        lychees, ginger and hints of grapefruit and white peach.
                        Gewürz is also often the answer when it comes to hard-to-match
                        spicy dishes like Thai food, aromatic Indian dishes, Vietnamese,
                        or Chinese, basically anything with fragrance and a mild-medium
                        chilli hit.</p>

                    <h2>Chenin Blanc</h2>
                    <p>The aromas and flavor notes include the descriptors of
                        minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced
                        from noble rot will have notes of peaches and honey that
                        develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age.
                        Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have
                        notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into
                        more honey, acacia, and quince aromas.</p>

                    <h2>Riesling</h2>
                    <p>Riesling is a bit of an enigma; ethereal, floral and
                        enchanting, riesling is also one of the world's hardiest grape
                        varieties, with a high level of frost resistance meaning it
                        thrives in some of the coolest climate wine regions. This
                        aromatic grape variety makes some of the world's finest white
                        wines in a vast variety of styles, the best of which will age
                        brilliantly, turning from floral, lime aromas and flavours to
                        intriguing developed aromas of kerosene.</p>
